# Kinda finally did it ? 


So over the past few weeks I have been working on my homelab, and I have learnt sooo much along the way, and I figured, the best way to post about it was to write about it. So I wrote an article on linkedln https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/project-home-lab-part-1-duncan-njoroge-k6roc/?trackingId=xvkKya%2FfRE%2BFavksulcKxw%3D%3D Which elicited a lot of interest. But I also not only wanted to document it there, I wanted to be able to share it to the world, so that when they search for something related to " how do I begin a homelab, they will find some footing. 

Then I went a step further, I wanted to access my homelab from the internet, safely. So that when I want to test or think about something, and want to deploy it, i just do it. Which led me to cloudflare. And now I have a CI/CD thing majig where I can make changes locally from my machine to my github repo and it automatically deploys to cloudflare pages, and makes my website live across the globe. 

Interesting, huh? but it does not end there. I have a cloudflare tunnel , and now I'm reading about cloudflare workers , and workers AI, and at the same time been raving about @warpdotdev on X because this agentic terminal has been a life saver. And don't get me started on azure.. There. Is . A . LOT i have learnt over the past 50 days homelabbing. And now I want to share it on this little corner of the internet.

Do feel welcome, and when you see a post from me, share ? leave a comment , and let's get takling. 

And yes, I'm glad i finally did it!

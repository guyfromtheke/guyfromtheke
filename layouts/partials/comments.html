    UTTERANCES COMMENT SYSTEM SETUP
    ===============================
    
    This partial implements the utterances commenting system which uses GitHub issues for comments.
    
    TO SET UP:
    1. Create a GitHub repository where you want to store the comments (can be your website repo or a dedicated one)
    2. Install the utterances app on your GitHub repo: https://github.com/apps/utterances
    3. Update the "repo" attribute below with your GitHub username and repository name in the format: username/repo-name
    4. Choose a theme that matches your website (options: github-light, github-dark, preferred-color-scheme, 
       github-dark-orange, icy-dark, dark-blue, photon-dark, boxy-light)
    5. Ensure you've enabled comments in your config.yaml:
       params:
         comments: true
